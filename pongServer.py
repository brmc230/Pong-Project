# Purpose:                  Code that implements the server side of the Pong game and interacts with
#                           the client
# Misc:

import socket
import threading

# Use this file to write your server logic
# You will need to support at least two clients
# You will need to keep track of where on the screen (x,y coordinates) each paddle is, the score 
#   for each player and where the ball is, and relay that to each client
# I suggest you use the sync variable in pongClient.py to determine how out of sync your two
#   clients are and take actions to resync the games
# Make precautions for if someone enters the wrong IP or port and if a 3rd person attempts to 
#   connect to an already full game

# Dont know yet about getting this info, just rolling with it
host = ""
ip = ""

# Create the server
server = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
server.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1) # For local host use
server.bind((host, ip))

# Getting client information
client_socket, client_ip = server.accept()
